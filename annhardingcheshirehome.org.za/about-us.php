           ABOUT US
           <h4>Vision, Mission and Values</h4>
           <p>Ann Harding Cheshire Home is a registered Non-Profit Organisation for the care, education, training and development of persons with physical disabilities of all races and religions.
            Our inspiration is our 40 Residents.  The people who, despite their physical disabilites maintain a sense of humour.  Those Residents who, despite their physical limitations complete 5km in the 702 Walk the Talk every  year.  The Residents whose lives were changed in an instant, victims of crime, or motor vehicle accidents.  The small percentage who have genetic illnesses, or those who were struck down in their prime with a debilitating illness.  It could be any one of us.  The majority of our Residents never thought they would find themselves living in a Home for the Physically Disabled.
            </p>
            <h4>History of the Ann Harding Cheshire Home</h4>
            <p>Ann Harding Cheshire Homes was opened in 1976 in a house and land donated by the Council.  The house, which is now the Charity Shop, was only large enough to house eight Residents, and even that was tight.</p>
            <p>Development of the surrounding land only took place much later, and in 1988 a building to house 40 Residents was opened.</p>
            <p>The Home is named after the physically disabled mother of one Benjamin Charles Harding who originally donated property for the Home which proved unsuitable for development.  This property was sold, and the money used to develop the current land.</p>
            <h4>Primary Services</h4>
            <p>We provide our Residents, all of whom live here permanently, with comfortable accommodation, 24 hour care, nutritious meals, laundry, access to therapists and social worker as well as physiotherapists, state clinics and hospitals and private practitioners using our own specially adapted vehicles.</p>
            <p>The majority of our 40 residents have taken up permanent residence having suffered from, and becoming permanently disabled as a result of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motor vehicle accidents</li>
                <li>Violence and assault</li>
                <li>Strokes</li>
                <li>Degenerative diseases</li>
                <li>Congenital disabilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A wide variety of daily activities keeps our Residents motivated and educated.  The more popular ones are arts and crafts, painting, bingo, chess and card games.  More recently (2014), we have upgraded our swimming pool, which is now a heated therapy pool.  Residents are enjoying spending time in the pool with our full-time Occupational Therapist, as well a private Physiotherapists.</p>

            <h4>SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
            <p>In addition to applying for funding, Ann Harding also hold a number of fundraising events each year.  These are always very successful and assist enormously with costs.
            We also run a very successful Charity Shop, which is well supported by the local community.
            Long term plans include building self-living units, which will be sold on a life-rights basis.
            The Home has a hall which is hired out to companies for meetings, training courses etc.

            <h4>WHAT WE CAN OFFER</h4>
            <p>Ann Harding Cheshire Home has a committee of dedicated members who ensure exemplary ethics and code of conduct, and that any funds received are used for the intended purpose.  Monthly reports detail the progress made in the utilisation of all donations, sponsorships and bequests made.
                Ann Harding Home is run like a business, with the care and advancement of our residents the first priority. The residents themselves have a significant say in the running of the home, through the Residents' Committee, which is fully represented on the Home Management Committee.
                The Home is registered as a PBO, and can therefore offer Section 18a certificates for tax purposes.
            </p>
            <p>For capital projects we offer naming rights, which bring the prestige of being associated with a long-standing NGO in the community.</p>
            <p>Our donors are proud to be associated with us, because of our good reputation and transparency.  We are in good standing with the local media, schools and businesses in the community, and have the privilege of being supported by numerous volunteers from all walks of life.  We prefer to build long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships that deliver significant benefits to disabled people and the stakeholders of a business alike.</p>
            <h4>IN CONCLUSION</h4>
            <p>The best way to assess our services is to visit our Home, and we welcome such visits.
                The Home is a warm, homely place, with beautiful gardens and a swimming pool.  Common areas include lounges, tea areas, computer room, therapy room, dining area.
